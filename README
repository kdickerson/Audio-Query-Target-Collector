A simple Python GTK (Python-Glade) app to facilitate collecting audio samples matched in time with a source file.
I created this to collect Query-Target pairs for training my algorithm in my thesis on musical query-by-content.

Built against the Python 2.5.  Python 3 compatibility unknown.  Uses Linux specific tools (was unable to get a pure Python implementation working).

Dependencies:
  python:  pygtk 2.0, gtk, gtk.glade
  linux: mplayer, vlc, arecord

This is not polished code.  I was on a time crunch and got it to be just good enough.
I was hoping to get a nice piece of code that could play any audio type and record a matching query from the user,
  but several issues occured which I think eventually prevented me from using anything but flac and wav, which is dumb.

Given a directory of target audio files, the app will crawl through for usable ones.
A random snippet of X seconds from these songs will presented to the user.
The user can preview the snippet as many times as desired.
The user then clicks record and the snippet plays again while they record their query.
  - User should be wearing headphones to prevent leaking the true signal into the query.

Before starting the user enters a User ID so they can work in several sessions and we can keep track of all their work.
